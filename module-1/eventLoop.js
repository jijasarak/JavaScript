// Javascript is a single-threaded, non-blocking language

// JavaScript runtime environment (e.g., V8 engine)

// The heap: The heap handles memory allocation so we don't have to 

// The call Stack: As JavaScript is single threaded, the call stack can only execute one piece of code at a time in its single thread

// JavaScript gets a helping hand: webAPIs, Task Queue, Event Loop

// JavaScript is single-threaded (But can still multitask!): .setTimeout, .setInterval, Fetching data across the network, Promises

//? What are WebAPIs?
